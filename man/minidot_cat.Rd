Edits:

* Renamed function

* Added local_tz as a parameter.

* Replaced lubridate::use_tz with as.POSIXct.

* Added format to avoid loss of time on midnight entries.

* Added serial number as column.

* Swapped order of operations so if fail condition is triggered it happens
before any work is done.

* Added working example with data.
