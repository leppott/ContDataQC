# Run Functions

The three main functions are listed in the drop-down menu under 'Choose 
Operation to perform'

-   **'QC raw data'** generates QC reports.

-   **'Aggregate QC'd data'** merges the QC'd data files for the desired time periods together. The input files need to be from the same site and share common parameters.

-   **'Summary statistics'** generates two sets of CSV files and a PDF with time series plots for each parameter. One of the CSVs has daily means and the other has a wider range of summary statistics (e.g., min, median, max, quartiles).

ContDataQC works sequentially, meaning the user needs to run the QC function before running the Aggregate function, and the Aggregate function before the SummaryStats function. More detailed information on each function can be found below.

Time-saver tip: if you use Google Chrome as your internet browser, you can change its settings so that it asks what folder to download files to (versus files going to the default Download folder). Click [here](https://github.com/Blocktt/ShinyAppDocuments/tree/main/ContDataQC/Run_Functions_Files) for instructions on how to set this up.

### QC reports

Shiny app instructions
1.	Click the ‘Browse’ button and select the input file(s) from the Data1_RAW folder. You can run multiple files at once. The status bar will tell you when the upload is complete.

2.	Select ‘QC Raw Data’ from the ‘Choose Operation to perform’ drop-down menu

3.	A ‘Run operation’ button will appear. Click this button. A status bar will appear in the lower right corner.

4.	After the function is done running, a ‘Download’ button will appear. Click this button.

5.	Save the zipped file in the Data2_QC folder.

6.	Open the QC reports. There are two types of outputs: a Data Quality Control Report that comes as either a Word document or Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) (the user specifies the desired format); and a comma-delimited (.csv) spreadsheet. The reports include results from the ‘flag’ tests (gross, spike, rate of change and flat line), missing data checks and time series plots. Click here to download an example of a QC output.

7.	Review each set of files, check flagged data points, do visual checks on the time series plots, and decide if and how to make corrections. For tips on the QC process, see the ‘QC tips’ subtab. 

The Data Quality Control Report is organized into four main sections, starting with an overall summary followed by summaries for each parameter:

1.	Data file information (siteID, date range, parameters, recording interval, QC test thresholds reference table)

2.	‘Count’ tables (# measurements/day) so that you can find inconsistencies (too few measurements (=missing data) or too many measurements)

3.	Results from the four ‘flag’ tests (gross, spike, rate of change and flat line) - # of entries marked as pass (P), suspect (S), fail (F), missing data (X) or not available (NA)

4.	Time series plots for each individual parameter and two sets of combined parameters (water and air temperature; water temperature and water level). If the input file includes discrete/in situ values , which are taken during site visits for accuracy checks, the discrete values are plotted with the sensor data. .

The CSV file contains the time series data from the sensor plus additional data columns with flags for each test and parameter (e.g., Flag.Spike.Water.Temp.C, Flag.Flat.Water.Temp.C), comment fields for each parameter (e.g., Comment.MOD.Water.Temp.C) so that the user can document rationale for any changes and a duplicate set of the original ‘raw’ data values (e.g., RAW.Water.Temp.C). The ‘raw’ values are included  so that the user can maintain documentation of changes that are made and go back at a later time if desired to change how they handled a correction.

Currently there are no automated corrections programmed into the QC function. The user must make the changes manually. For tips on the QC process, see the ‘QC tips’ subtab. 

### Aggregate

Shiny app instructions

1.	Click the ‘Browse’ button and select the input files from the Data2_QC folder that you’d like to combine together. The status bar will tell you when the upload is complete.

2.	Select ‘Aggregate QC’d data’ from the ‘Choose Operation to perform’ drop-down menu

3.	A ‘Run operation’ button will appear. Click this button. A status bar will appear in the lower right corner.

4.	After the function is done running, a ‘Download’ button will appear. Click this button. Save the zipped file in the Data3_Aggregated folder.

5.	Save the zipped file in the Data3_Aggregated folder.

6.	Open and review the aggregated reports. As with the QC output, there are two types of outputs: a Data Quality Control Report that comes as either a Word document or Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) (the user specifies the desired format); and a comma-delimited (.csv) spreadsheet. Click here to download an example of an Aggregate output.


### Summary statistics

Shiny app instructions

1.  Click the 'Browse' button and select the desired input file from the Data3_Aggregated folder. The status bar will tell you when the upload is complete.

2.  Select 'Summary statistics' from the 'Choose Operation to perform' drop-down menu

3.  A 'Run operation' button will appear. Click this button. A status bar will appear in the lower right corner.

4.  After the function is done running, a 'Download' button will appear. Click this button.

5.  Save the zipped file in the Data4_Stats folder.

6.  Open and review the summary statistics reports. There should be two sets of CSV files and a PDF with time series plots for each parameter. One of the CSVs has daily means and the other has a wider range of summary statistics (e.g., min, median, max, quartiles). Click [here](https://github.com/Blocktt/ShinyAppDocuments/tree/main/ContDataQC/Run_Functions_Files) to download an example of a Summary Stats output.
