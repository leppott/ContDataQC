### QC reports

Shiny app instructions

1.	Click the ‘Browse’ button and select the input file(s) from the Data1_RAW 
folder. You can run multiple files at once. The status bar will tell you when 
the upload is complete.

2.	Select ‘QC Raw Data’ from the ‘Choose Operation to perform’ drop-down menu

3.	A ‘Run operation’ button will appear. Click this button. A status bar will
appear in the lower right corner.

4.	After the function is done running, a ‘Download’ button will appear. Click
this button.

5.	You will be prompted to save a zipped file named ‘QCRaw.date_time.’ Save it in the Data2_QC folder.

6.	Unzip/extract the file(s). After file is unzipped, a new folder called ‘data’ will appear, which contains QC reports that have ‘QC_’ as the prefix in the file name. The original zipped file can be deleted if desired.

7.	Open the QC reports. There are two types of outputs: a Word document Data Quality Control Report  and a comma-delimited (.csv) spreadsheet. The reports include results from the ‘flag’ tests (gross, spike, rate of change and flat line), missing data checks and time series plots. Click [here](Example_QCreports.zip) [ZIP] to download an example of a QC output. If users prefer a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) report instead of Word, they can change the format in the configuration file (this requires some familiarity with R code).

8.	Review each set of files, check flagged data points, do visual checks on the
time series plots, and decide if and how to make corrections. For tips on the QC
process, see the ‘About - QC tips’ subtab. 

The Data Quality Control Report is organized into four main sections, starting 
with an overall summary followed by summaries for each parameter:

1.	Data file information (siteID, date range, parameters, recording interval, 
QC test thresholds reference table)

2.	‘Count’ tables (# measurements/day) so that you can find inconsistencies 
(too few measurements (=missing data) or too many measurements)

3.	Results from the four ‘flag’ tests (gross, spike, rate of change and flat 
line) - # of entries marked as pass (P), suspect (S), fail (F), missing data (X)
or not available (NA)

4.	Time series plots for each individual parameter and two sets of combined 
parameters (water and air temperature; water temperature and water level). If 
the input file includes discrete/in situ values , which are taken during site 
visits for accuracy checks, the discrete values are plotted with the sensor 
data.

The CSV file contains the time series data from the sensor plus additional data 
columns with flags for each test and parameter (e.g., Flag.Spike.Water.Temp.C, Flag.Flat.Water.Temp.C), comment fields for each parameter (e.g., 
Comment.MOD.Water.Temp.C) so that the user can document rationale for any 
changes and a duplicate set of the original ‘raw’ data values (e.g., 
RAW.Water.Temp.C). The ‘raw’ values are included  so that the user can maintain
documentation of changes that are made and go back at a later time if desired to 
change how they handled a correction.

Currently there are no automated corrections programmed into the QC function. 
The user must make the changes manually. For tips on the QC process, see the 
‘About - QC tips’ subtab.
