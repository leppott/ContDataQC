### Summary Statistics

**Example** [Summary Stats output](Example_SumStats.zip) [ZIP]

Shiny app instructions

1.  Click the 'Browse' button and select the desired input file from the 
Data3_Aggregated folder. The status bar will tell you when the upload is 
complete.

2.  Select 'Summary statistics' from the 'Choose Operation to perform' drop-down menu.

3.  A 'Run operation' button will appear. Click this button. A status bar will appear in the lower right corner.

4.  After the function is done running, a ‘Download’ button will appear. Click this button. You will be prompted to save a zipped file named ‘SummaryStats.date_time.’ Save it in the Data4_Stats folder.

5.  Unzip/extract the file(s). After file is unzipped, a new folder called ‘data’ will appear. If a ‘data’ folder already exists, outputs will go into that folder. The summary stats reports have ‘STATS_’ as the prefix in the file name. The original zipped file can be deleted if desired.

6.  Open and review the summary statistics reports. There should be two sets of CSV files and a PDF with time series plots for each parameter. One of the CSVs has daily means and the other has a wider range of summary statistics (e.g., min, median, max, quartiles).
