### Aggregate

Shiny app instructions

1.	Click the ‘Browse’ button and select the input files from the Data2_QC 
folder that you’d like to combine together. The status bar will tell you when 
the upload is complete.

2.	Select ‘Aggregate QC’d data’ from the ‘Choose Operation to perform’ 
drop-down menu

3.	A ‘Run operation’ button will appear. Click this button. A status bar will 
appear in the lower right corner.

4.	After the function is done running, a ‘Download’ button will appear. Click 
this button. Save the zipped file in the Data3_Aggregated folder.

5.	Save the zipped file in the Data3_Aggregated folder.

6.	Open and review the aggregated reports. As with the QC output, there are two
types of outputs: a Data Quality Control Report that comes as either a Word 
document or Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) (the user specifies the desired 
format); and a comma-delimited (.csv) spreadsheet. Click 
[here](Example_Aggregate.zip) to download an example of an Aggregate output.
