### Aggregate

Shiny app instructions

1.	Click the ‘Browse’ button and select the QC’d input files that you’d like to combine. The input files need to be from the same site and share common parameters. The status bar will tell you when the upload is complete.

2.	Select ‘Aggregate QC’d data’ from the ‘Choose Operation to perform’ drop-down menu.
3.	A ‘Run operation’ button will appear. Click this button. A status bar will appear in the lower right corner.

4.	After the function is done running, a ‘Download’ button will appear. Click this button. You will be prompted to save a zipped file named ‘Aggregate.date_time.’ Save it in the Data3_Aggregated folder.

5.	 Unzip/extract the file(s). After file is unzipped, a new folder called ‘data’ will appear. If a ‘data’ folder already exists, outputs will go into that folder. The aggregate reports have ‘DATA_’ as the prefix in the file name. The original zipped file can be deleted if desired.

6.	Open and review the aggregated reports. As with the QC output, there are two types of outputs: a Word document Data Quality Control Report and a comma-delimited (.csv) spreadsheet. Click [here](Example_Aggregate.zip) to download an example of an Aggregate output.  If users prefer a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) report instead of Word, they can change the format in the configuration file (this requires some familiarity with R code).
