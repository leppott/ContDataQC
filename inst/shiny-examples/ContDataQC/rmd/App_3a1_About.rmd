# Run Functions

The three main functions are listed in the drop-down menu under 'Choose 
Operation to perform'

-   **'QC raw data'** generates QC reports.

-   **'Aggregate QC'd data'** merges the QC'd data files for the desired time 
periods together. The input files need to be from the same site and share common
parameters.

-   **'Summary statistics'** generates two sets of CSV files and a PDF with time
series plots for each parameter. One of the CSVs has daily means and the other 
has a wider range of summary statistics (e.g., min, median, max, quartiles).

ContDataQC works sequentially, meaning the user needs to run the QC function 
before running the Aggregate function, and the Aggregate function before the 
SummaryStats function. More detailed information on each function can be found 
below.

Time-saver tip: if you use Google Chrome as your internet browser, you can 
change its settings so that it asks what folder to download files to (versus 
files going to the default Download folder). Click 
[here](GoogleChrome_TimesaverTips.pdf) for instructions on how to set this up.
