# Organizing Files

If you do not already have a good system for organizing continuous data files, 
we recommend setting up folders as shown below as a starting point. Folders and 
files can be customized as you gain more experience. The files should be backed
up regularly and accessible to other members of your data management team.

Click [here](FolderSetUp_20220825.zip) to download a zipped file with a 
ready-made set of (empty) folders.  Put the file in the desired location, unzip 
it and then replace ‘SiteX’ with the appropriate site name.

You have more flexibility with file organization when using the Shiny app vs R 
package. With the Shiny app, it is not necessary to name the folders exactly as 
shown below because you can browse to the desired input files and browse to save
the output files to the desired location. However, if you decide to use the R 
package at some point, keeping the four ‘Data’ folders (Data0_Original, 
Data1_RAW, Data2_QC, Data3_Aggregated and Data4_Stats) will be important since 
the R code searches in specific folders for input files and outputs files to 
specific directories. Advanced R users can modify the default directories by 
editing the configuration file. 

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%"}
knitr::include_graphics("RMD_Images/Fig_Organizing_v1_20210616.png")
```

### Folder descriptions
```{r table_1}
library(readxl)
library(knitr)
library(kableExtra)
# state directories
table.dir <- "tables"
table.file <- "App_Information_Tables.xlsx"
tab2a.dir <- "DataPrep_Table2a"

table2a <- read_excel(file.path(table.dir, table.file), sheet = tab2a.dir
                     , na = c("NA", ""), trim_ws = TRUE, skip = 0
                     , col_names = TRUE)  

options(knitr.kable.NA = '')
# kable(table1)
table2a %>% 
  kbl() %>% 
  kable_styling(full_width = F, position = "left")
```
