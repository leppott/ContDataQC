# About ContDataQC

The ContDataQC Shiny app is a free R-based tool that was developed to help water
quality monitoring programs QC, merge and summarize continuous sensor data files
in a standardized, more efficient way. It also has a function that allows users 
to download U.S. Geological Survey gage data at sites and over periods of their 
choosing. This Shiny app is linked to the ContDataQC R package, which was 
developed by Erik W. Leppo from Tetra Tech (Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com) and is 
available on <a href="https://github.com/leppott/ContDataQC" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.

The ContDataQC R package and Shiny app were developed with the following 
objectives in mind: ensure that a certain (minimum) level of QC is being 
performed on continuous data files; standardize and speed up data QC and reduce 
missed errors; and standardize data for further analysis and sharing. The figure
below lays out the general workflow for using the ContDataQC R tools. Items in 
bold blue text show functions that can be performed with ContDataQC.

To date, ContDataQC has been used primarily on continuous temperature and 
hydrologic data but is also configured for conductivity, pH, turbidity, 
chlorophyll-a and salinity. Users with advanced R skills can add any other 
parameters that they desire by making edits to the
[configuration file](Config_default.zip), which can be viewed in R or in Notepad. 

Development of the ContDataQC R tools has been funded by the United States 
Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) Office of Research and Development (ORD) 
as part of a larger project to establish Regional Monitoring Networks (RMNs) for
freshwater streams and inland lakes (lead EPA scientist: Britta Bierwagen). The 
RMNs are a volunteer, collaborative effort in which entities collect long-term 
continuous temperature and hydrologic data at targeted sites to detect changes 
over time. For more information on the RMNs, please refer to the 
<a href="https://cfpub.epa.gov/ncea/global/recordisplay.cfm?deid=307973" target="blank">stream Regional Monitoring Networks report</a>.

# Who to contact if you have problems or comments

This is an open-source, collaborative effort. If you encounter problems with the Shiny app and/or have suggestions on ways to further improve it, please contact Erik W. Leppo from Tetra Tech via email (Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com) or via a post on the <a href="https://github.com/leppott/ContDataQC/discussions" target="_blank">ContDataQC GitHub Discussions page</a>.
