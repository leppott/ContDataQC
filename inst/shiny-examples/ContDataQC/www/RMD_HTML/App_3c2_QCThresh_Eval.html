<h2>Evaluate Thresholds</h2>
<p>If you have one or more years of continuous data for a site, we
strongly encourage you to evaluate the performance of the QC test
thresholds for each parameter at that site and customize the
configuration file if needed.</p>
<p>Click <a href="EvaluateThresholds.zip">here</a> for instructions on
how to generate pivot tables and plots to evaluate thresholds for the
Unrealistic values (‘Gross range’) and Spike tests.</p>
<p>Another option is to use R code written by Tim Martin (Minnesota DNR)
to generate statistical outputs that can help inform thresholds for all
four QC tests. Click <a href="TimMartin_R_ThresholdEval.zip">here</a> to
download the R scripts and instructions.</p>
<p>To aid with documentation of the threshold evaluation process, click
<a href="ThresholdsCheckWorksheet_20220826.xlsx">here</a> to download an
Excel worksheet that lists the default thresholds for each parameter and
has a column where you can enter the customized values for a given site
as well as rationale for making the changes. When doing this, make sure
you consider what units you are using (as well as what the defaults
are), since units have a large effect on thresholds.</p>
