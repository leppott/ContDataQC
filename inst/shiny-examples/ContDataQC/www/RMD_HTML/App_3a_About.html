<h1>Run Functions</h1>
<p>The three main functions are listed in the drop-down menu under
‘Choose Operation to perform’</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>‘QC raw data’</strong> generates QC reports.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>‘Aggregate QC’d data’</strong> merges the QC’d data files
for the desired time periods together. The input files need to be from
the same site and share common parameters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>‘Summary statistics’</strong> generates two sets of CSV
files and a PDF with time series plots for each parameter. One of the
CSVs has daily means and the other has a wider range of summary
statistics (e.g., min, median, max, quartiles).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>ContDataQC works sequentially, meaning the user needs to run the QC
function before running the Aggregate function, and the Aggregate
function before the SummaryStats function. More detailed information on
each function can be found below.</p>
<p>Time-saver tip: if you use Google Chrome as your internet browser,
you can change its settings so that it asks what folder to download
files to (versus files going to the default Download folder). Click <a href="GoogleChrome_TimesaverTips.pdf">here</a> for instructions on how
to set this up.</p>

<h3>QC reports</h3>
<p>Shiny app instructions</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Click the ‘Browse’ button and select the input file(s) from the
Data1_RAW folder. You can run multiple files at once. The status bar
will tell you when the upload is complete.</p></li>
<li><p>Select ‘QC Raw Data’ from the ‘Choose Operation to perform’
drop-down menu</p></li>
<li><p>A ‘Run operation’ button will appear. Click this button. A status
bar will appear in the lower right corner.</p></li>
<li><p>After the function is done running, a ‘Download’ button will
appear. Click this button.</p></li>
<li><p>Save the zipped file in the Data2_QC folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the QC reports. There are two types of outputs: a Data
Quality Control Report that comes as either a Word document or Hypertext
Markup Language (HTML) (the user specifies the desired format); and a
comma-delimited (.csv) spreadsheet. The reports include results from the
‘flag’ tests (gross, spike, rate of change and flat line), missing data
checks and time series plots. Click <a href="Example_QCreports.zip">here</a> to download an example of a QC
output.</p></li>
<li><p>Review each set of files, check flagged data points, do visual
checks on the time series plots, and decide if and how to make
corrections. For tips on the QC process, see the ‘QC tips’
subtab.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Data Quality Control Report is organized into four main sections,
starting with an overall summary followed by summaries for each
parameter:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Data file information (siteID, date range, parameters, recording
interval, QC test thresholds reference table)</p></li>
<li><p>‘Count’ tables (# measurements/day) so that you can find
inconsistencies (too few measurements (=missing data) or too many
measurements)</p></li>
<li><p>Results from the four ‘flag’ tests (gross, spike, rate of change
and flat line) - # of entries marked as pass (P), suspect (S), fail (F),
missing data (X) or not available (NA)</p></li>
<li><p>Time series plots for each individual parameter and two sets of
combined parameters (water and air temperature; water temperature and
water level). If the input file includes discrete/in situ values , which
are taken during site visits for accuracy checks, the discrete values
are plotted with the sensor data.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The CSV file contains the time series data from the sensor plus
additional data columns with flags for each test and parameter (e.g.,
Flag.Spike.Water.Temp.C, Flag.Flat.Water.Temp.C), comment fields for
each parameter (e.g., Comment.MOD.Water.Temp.C) so that the user can
document rationale for any changes and a duplicate set of the original
‘raw’ data values (e.g., RAW.Water.Temp.C). The ‘raw’ values are
included so that the user can maintain documentation of changes that are
made and go back at a later time if desired to change how they handled a
correction.</p>
<p>Currently there are no automated corrections programmed into the QC
function. The user must make the changes manually. For tips on the QC
process, see the ‘QC tips’ subtab.</p>

<h3>Aggregate</h3>

<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Click the ‘Browse’ button and select the input files from the
Data2_QC folder that you’d like to combine together. The status bar will
tell you when the upload is complete.</p></li>

perform’ drop-down menu</p></li>
<li><p>A ‘Run operation’ button will appear. Click this button. A status

appear. Click this button. Save the zipped file in the Data3_Aggregated
folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Save the zipped file in the Data3_Aggregated folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Open and review the aggregated reports. As with the QC output,
there are two types of outputs: a Data Quality Control Report that comes
as either a Word document or Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) (the user
specifies the desired format); and a comma-delimited (.csv) spreadsheet.
