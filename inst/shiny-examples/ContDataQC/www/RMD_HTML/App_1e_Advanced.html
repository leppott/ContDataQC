<h1>Advanced</h1>
<p>Users with intermediate to advanced-level computer skills can
customize the settings of the ContDataQC app (e.g., by adding new
parameters, changing units, changing file naming and formatting
requirements, changing the format of one of the QC reports from Word to
html or PDF) by editing a plain text <a href="Config_default.zip">configuration file</a> [ZIP]. You can do this
in R or Notepad.</p>
<p>Some users may prefer to use the ContDataQC

<span aria-hidden="true">Exit</span> <span class="u-visually-hidden">
Exit EPA Website</span> </span> </a> instead of the Shiny app. While
using the R code allows for some additional layers of customization,
when it comes to file naming schemes and setting directories, users have
more flexibility using the Shiny app because they can browse to the
desired input file(s).</p>
