<h1>Advanced</h1>
<p>Some users may prefer to use the
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/ContDataQC" target="_blank">R
code</a> instead of the Shiny app. The example code in Figure 1 shows
how to run the main functions when using the default settings in the R
package. After the user directs R to the correct directories and selects
the operation (QCRaw, Aggregate or SummaryStats), there are several
places in the code where the user needs to make entries (e.g., SiteID,
sensor type, and start/end date). R will read through the file names in
the directory, select files that match the criteria and generate outputs
for each input file that matches the criteria.</p>
<p>Users with intermediate to advanced-level R skills can customize the
settings (e.g., add new parameters, change units, change file naming and
formatting requirements, change the format of one of the QC reports from
Word to html or PDF) by editing a plain text <a href="Config_default.zip">configuration file</a> [ZIP]. Users have more
flexibility using the Shiny app versus R package when it comes to
setting directories and file naming schemes because they can browse to
the desired input file(s).</p>
