<p>Users with intermediate to advanced-level computer skills can
customize the settings (e.g., add new parameters, change units, change
file naming and formatting requirements, change the format of one of the
QC reports from Word to html or PDF) by editing a plain text <a href="Config_default.zip">configuration file</a> [ZIP]. You can do this
in R or Notepad.</p>
<p>Some users may prefer to use the ContDataQC

<span aria-hidden="true">Exit</span> <span class="u-visually-hidden">
Exit EPA Website</span> </span> </a> instead of the Shiny app. While
using the R code allows for some additional layers of customization
beyond this, when it comes to file naming schemes and setting
directories, users have more flexibility using the Shiny app because
they can browse to the desired input file(s).</p>
