<h1>Frequently asked questions</h1>
<p><strong>Q: Do I need R software installed on my computer to run the
online version of the Shiny app?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, only internet access is required.</p>
<p><strong>Q: I have slow internet speed. Is there a way to run the
Shiny app off my local computer to speed things up?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, if you have R software installed on your computer, you can
run ContDataQC as a Shiny app on your local computer and it will likely
be faster.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What internet browsers is this website compatible
with?</strong></p>
<p>A: It has been tested and run successfully with Google Chrome,
Firefox and Microsoft Edge. It may be compatible with other browsers but
they have not been tested. Google Chrome is most frequently used. It
allows users to specify what folder to download files to, which can be a
time saver.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Why isn’t my spreadsheet processing? The screen grays out
and says ‘disconnected from the server’.</strong></p>
<p>A: Your input file may not be formatted correctly. Start by checking
that. If you don’t find anything, send your input file(s) and a copy of
your error message to Erik Leppo (<a href="mailto:Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com" class="email">Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com</a>) and he’ll do his best to
help you troubleshoot. It could also be the Shiny app. Sometimes after
we fix or update one thing, something else stops working, or R software
makes an update which throws something in our code off.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Is there a size limit on how big a file (or files) I can
upload?</strong></p>
<p>A: The limit is currently set to 70 MB but we can increase that if
needed (email Erik Leppo (<a href="mailto:Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com" class="email">Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com</a>) with your request).</p>
<p><strong>Q: What’s the limit on the number of spreadsheets I can
upload?</strong></p>
<p>A: There is no limit but the more files you run at once, the longer
the processing time. We find it’s often faster and easier to run smaller
batches (for example, 4 smaller batches of 1 to 5 files versus 20 files
all at once) but it’s up to the user.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can other people download my files from the
website?</strong></p>
<p>A: No, each time the application is run it is independent from all
other versions. That is, each user has their own copy of the app. Once
the browser is closed that version is removed from the server along with
all of the uploaded data.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can multiple people use this website
simultaneously?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, because it is on a Shiny server, multiple people can use it
at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I use this website on my phone?</strong></p>
<p>A: Mobile use of this app is possible. A tablet should be fine but
the screen size of a phone may make it impractical.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What if I run the aggregate function on input files with
overlapping date ranges? Are all records (even duplicates) included in
the output?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, the Shiny app will include all records, even the duplicates.
It is up to the user to identify when these situations are occurring and
remove the duplicate rows before running the files through the various
functions.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What if there are discrepancies between the SiteID and
date ranges in the file name versus what’s in the actual
file?</strong></p>
<p>A: The tool will still work. The output file names will use the site
IDs and date ranges in the input file names. The output spreadsheets
themselves will use the site IDs and date ranges inside the files
(i.e. the dates of the first and last rows of each input file).
Nevertheless, it is good practice to have both things match.</p>
<p><strong>Q: What will happen if I accidentally run the wrong process
on my input files (e.g., you run the QC operation but had intended to
run the Aggregate function)?</strong></p>
<p>A: Either the tool won’t run at all or it will produce output files
with weird names (e.g., if you run the QC operation on files you’ve
already run through the QC operation, you’ll get output files that start
with the name ‘QC_QC_’).</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I change the QC test thresholds that the QC process
uses?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, visit the ‘Customize QC Thresholds’ tab.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Can I simultaneously download data from different USGS
gages for different time periods?</strong></p>
<p>A: Not at this time. Currently, all USGS gages you enter will have
data downloaded over the same time period.</p>
<p><strong>Q: Are you working on a Shiny app that offers more options
for data summary and visualization?</strong></p>
<p>A: Yes, a beta version of the ContDataSumViz app will come online in
fall 2022. In addition, for lakes, the beta version of the LakeMonitoR
<a href="https://github.com/leppott/LakeMonitoR" target="_blank">R
package</a> and
<a href="https://tetratech-wtr-wne.shinyapps.io/LakeMonitoR" target="_blank">Shiny
app</a> are available.</p>
