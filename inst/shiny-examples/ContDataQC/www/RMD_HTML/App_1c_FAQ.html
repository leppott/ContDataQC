<h1>Basic Information</h1>
<p><strong>Requirements:</strong> You do not need R software installed
on your computer to run this Shiny app. You only need an internet
connection.</p>
<p><strong>Failure to run:</strong> When the Shiny app fails to run, the
screen will gray out and the message ‘disconnected from the server’ will
appear. The problem typically stems from a formatting issue with the
input file, in particular the Date/Time field. Check your input file,
refresh the app and try again. If you still have problems, click the
‘contact us’ link at the bottom of this page and request assistance. Be
prepared to share a copy of your input file(s) and the error
message.</p>
<strong>Speed:</strong> If you have a slow internet connection, you can
run ContDataQC as a Shiny app on your local computer and it will likely
be faster. Running it locally requires that you have R software and the
ContDataQC R package installed on your computer, which can be downloaded
from GitHub

<p><strong>Internet browsers:</strong> This Shiny app has been tested
and run successfully with Google Chrome, Firefox and Microsoft Edge. It
may be compatible with other browsers but they have not been tested.
Google Chrome is most frequently used. Some browsers (like Chrome and
Firefox) allow users to specify what folder to download files to, which
can be a time saver.</p>
<p><strong>Limits on input file(s):</strong> The input file size limit
is currently set to 70 MB. This can be increased upon request. There is
no limit on the number of files you can upload but the more files you
run at once, the longer the processing time. It’s often faster and
easier to run smaller batches (for example, 4 smaller batches of 1 to 5
files versus 20 files all at once).</p>
<p><strong>Security:</strong> Other people cannot see or download your
files from the website. Each time the application is run it is
independent from all other versions. That is, each user has their own
copy of the app. Once the browser is closed, that version is removed
from the server along with all of the uploaded data.</p>
<p><strong>Simultaneous use:</strong> Because this Shiny app is on a
Shiny server, multiple people can use it at the same time.</p>
<p><strong>Customizing QC test thresholds:</strong> Instructions on how
to evaluate and customize thresholds can be found on the Main
Functions-QC Thresholds page.</p>
<p><strong>Usability on phones:</strong> Mobile use of this app is
possible although the screen size of a phone may make it
impractical.</p>
<strong>Data summary and visualization:</strong> The ContDataSumViz app
has more summary and visualization options. Shiny app (beta version):

<p><strong>Downloading USGS gage data:</strong>You can simultaneously
download data from different USGS gages but only for the same time
period.</p>
<p><strong>Aggregating files with overlapping dates:</strong> If you run
the aggregate function on input files with overlapping date ranges, all
records (even duplicates) are included in the output. It is up to the
user to identify when these situations are occurring and remove the
duplicate rows before running the files through the various
functions.</p>
