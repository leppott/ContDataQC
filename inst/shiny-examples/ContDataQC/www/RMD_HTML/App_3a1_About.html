<h1>Run Functions</h1>
<p>The three main functions are listed in the drop-down menu under
‘Choose Operation to perform’</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>‘QC raw data’</strong> generates QC reports.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>‘Aggregate QC’d data’</strong> merges the QC’d data files
for the desired time periods together. The input files need to be from
the same site and share common parameters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>‘Summary statistics’</strong> generates two sets of CSV
files and a PDF with time series plots for each parameter. One of the
CSVs has daily means and the other has a wider range of summary
statistics (e.g., min, median, max, quartiles).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>ContDataQC works sequentially, meaning the user needs to run the QC
function before running the Aggregate function, and the Aggregate
function before the SummaryStats function. More detailed information on
each function can be found below.</p>
<p>Time-saver tip: if you use Google Chrome as your internet browser,
you can change its settings so that it asks what folder to download
files to (versus files going to the default Download folder). Click <a href="GoogleChrome_TimesaverTips.pdf">here</a> for instructions on how
to set this up.</p>
