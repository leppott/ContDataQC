<h1>Workflow</h1>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Select QC flag test thresholds.</strong> Use the default
thresholds (‘Main - QC Thresholds - Default’ tab) or upload a customized
configuration file (‘Main - QC Thresholds - Upload Custom Thresholds’
tab). If you have one or more years of continuous data for a site, we
encourage you to evaluate the performance of the QC test thresholds for
each parameter at that site and customize the configuration file if
needed. Click ‘Main - QC Thresholds - Evaluate Thresholds’ tab for tips
on evaluating thresholds. To learn how to edit thresholds, click ‘Main -
QC Thresholds - Edit Thresholds’ tab.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check the configuration file name.</strong> Under Run
Functions (gray box, step 2), it will show the configuration file name
that will be used for the QC tests. Check to make sure the correct file
is being used. If you don’t upload a custom file, it will read
‘default’.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upload the desired input file(s).</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Run the ‘QC raw data’</strong> function to generate QC
reports.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>After the data file(s) are QC’d, users can run them
through the Aggregate function</strong> to merge them with other files.
The input files need to be from the same site and share common
parameters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The user can run the aggregated file through the Summary
Statistics function</strong> to generate CSV files with an assortment of
summary statistics (e.g., min, median, max, quartiles) and a PDF with
time series plots for each parameter.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>After running each function, users must unzip/extract the files or
else the files won’t be seen as an option to upload for the next step.
After files are unzipped, new folders will automatically appear and the
original zipped files can be deleted if desired.</p>
<p>Time-saver tip: some internet browsers, like Google Chrome and
Mozilla Firefox, allow users to change settings so that users can select
which folder to download files to (versus files going to the default
Download folder). * Mozilla Firefox: go to Settings &gt; General &gt;
Files and Applications &gt; Check box for “always ask where to save
files.” * <a href="GoogleChrome_TimesaverTips.pdf">Google Chrome file

<p>Some users may prefer to use the R code instead of the Shiny app. For
