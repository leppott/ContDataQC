<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p><strong>Select QC flag test thresholds.</strong> Use the default
thresholds (‘Main - QC Thresholds - Default’ tab) or upload a customized
configuration file (‘Main - QC Thresholds - Upload Custom Thresholds’
tab). If you have one or more years of continuous data for a site, we
encourage you to evaluate the performance of the QC test thresholds for
each parameter at that site and customize the configuration file if
needed. Click ‘Main - QC Thresholds - Evaluate Thresholds’ tab for tips
on evaluating thresholds. To learn how to edit thresholds, click ‘Main -
QC Thresholds - Edit Thresholds’ tab.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Check the configuration file name.</strong> Make sure the
correct configuration file has been uploaded prior to running the QC
reports.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Upload the desired input file(s).</strong></p></li>
<li><p><strong>Run the ‘QC raw data’</strong> function to generate QC
reports.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>After the data file(s) are QC’d, users can run them
through the Aggregate function</strong> to merge them with other files.
The input files need to be from the same site and share common
parameters.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>The user can run the aggregated file through the Summary
Statistics function</strong> to generate CSV files with an assortment of
summary statistics (e.g., min, median, max, quartiles) and a PDF with
time series plots for each parameter. After running each function, users
must unzip/extract the files or else the files won’t be seen as an
option to upload for the next step. After files are unzipped, new
folders will automatically appear and the original zipped files can be
deleted if desired. Time-saver tip: some internet browsers, like Google
Chrome and Mozilla Firefox, allow users to change settings so that users
can select which folder to download files to (versus files going to the
default Download folder). Click <a href="GoogleChrome_TimesaverTips.pdf">here</a> for instructions on how
to set this up in Chrome. With Mozilla Firefox, go to Settings &gt;
General &gt; Files and Applications &gt; Check box for “always ask where
to save files.”</p></li>
