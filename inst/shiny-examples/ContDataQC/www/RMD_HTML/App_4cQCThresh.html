<h2>Edit Thresholds</h2>
<p>Click <a href="EditingQCtestThresholds_20220117.pdf">here</a> for
instructions on how to edit thresholds and create customized
configuration files. There are two options (see below). For either
option, save the customized configuration file in a folder that is easy
to find so that you can reuse the file each time you QC data for that
site. It is helpful to include the StationID and other relevant
information in the file name (for example, if thresholds are customized
for a particular season).</p>
<p>After you save the file, go to the ‘upload custom thresholds’ tab,
browse to the custom thresholds file, upload the file and then, under
‘Main functions’, generate the QC reports. If you forget the upload
step, the default QC thresholds will be used.</p>
<div id="option-1-use-the-interactive-functions-shown-left-and-below." class="section level3">
<h3>Option 1, use the interactive functions shown left and below.</h3>
<ul>
<li><p>Select a parameter using the drop-down menu</p></li>
<li><p>Edit thresholds using boxes below</p></li>
<li><p>Save changes (for each parameter)</p></li>
<li><p>Download custom thresholds file</p></li>
</ul>
<p>If you do not want to use the default units, you will need to use
Option 2.</p>
<p>Acknowledgment: Tim Martin (MN DNR) wrote the R code that we used for
the interactive functions below.</p>

<h3>Option 2, download the default configuration file, open the file in
R or Notepad++, make edits and save.</h3>
<p>Configuration files can be downloaded here -</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="Config_default.zip">Default</a>, with hydrologic
parameters in feet</p></li>
<li><p><a href="Config_Lakes_meters.zip">Hydrologic parameters in
meters</a> Navigate to the ‘QC tests and calculations’ section. Edit
thresholds as desired. Save the file.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>When you download the configuration file(s), you will see two types
of files: an R file (.R) and a text (.txt) file for users who do not
have R installed on their computer. You can download R from this
website:
<a href="https://cran.r-project.org" target="_blank">https://cran.r-project.org</a>.
You may also want to download
<a href="https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/" target="_blank">RStudio</a>,
which is a separate program but is a useful code editor and interface
(IDE) for R. If you cannot install R on your computer, we recommend use
Notepad or
<a href="https://notepad-plus-plus.org/downloads" target="_blank">Notepad++</a>
(some people prefer Notepad++ because it has color-coding).</p>
