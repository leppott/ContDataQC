<h1>Naming Files</h1>
<p>You have more flexibility with naming files when using the Shiny app
vs R package because you can browse to the desired input file(s),
whereas the R package searches through files in a specified directory
and selects data files based on the file name. Even if you are using the
Shiny app, consider using the file naming scheme below since you may
decide to use the R package at some point in the future. Another reason
to use the recommended file naming scheme is because it keeps files well
organized and easy to sort. For example, if using HOBO U20 water level
loggers, it makes matching air and water sensor files easier during the
processing step and helps you identify gaps in the data. The recommended
file naming scheme is:</p>
<p>The recommended file naming scheme is:</p>
<p><strong>SiteID_DataType_StartDate_EndDate</strong></p>
<p>The four components are separated by underscores (“_”).</p>
<p>Example: Hunting_Water_20130426_20130725</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Site ID (no spaces or underscores) = Hunting</p></li>
<li><p>DataType: Air, Water, AW (air and water sensor data are combined
into the same file), Gage, DO</p></li>
<li><p>Date, Start (YYYYMMDD) = 20130426</p></li>
<li><p>Date, End (YYYYMMDD) = 20130725</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For multi-depth deployments (e.g., temperature sensors deployed at
multiple depths at a lake), depth and units are added to the SiteID,
separated by double-dashes as shown below:</p>
<p>Example: RussWood–01M_TEMP_20130426_20130725</p>
<p>Depth can include decimals (for example, 0.1M is ok) and does not
need to include leading zeros (either 01M or 1M are acceptable). Units
can be upper or lower case (M or m), and abbreviated (M) or spelled out
(meters). You can change the double-dash separator if desired by
customizing the <a href="Config_default.zip">configuration file</a>
[ZIP] (for example, you could change it to a tilde ~).</p>
<p>If you are using the Shiny app and have more than one type of sensor
deployed at the same depth (for example, both a DO and temperature
sensor at 2M), you can put the sensor type in the second part of the
file name (for example, DataType = TEMP, as shown in the example above,
or DataType = DO).</p>
<p>Below are examples of files that follow the recommended naming
scheme.</p>
<p>Example files from a RMN stream sties, where one temperature sensor
was deployed on land and the other in the water. In the AW files, air
and water sensore data were combined into the same file.</p>

<p>Example file for a lake RMN site where temperature sensors were
deployed at multiple depths and DO sensors were also deployed. The two
types of sensors overlapped at the 2M depth and the second part of the
file name (DataType) was used to distinguish between the two (TEMP
vs. DO).</p>
