<h1>Naming Files</h1>
<p>You have more flexibility with naming files when using the Shiny app
vs R package because you can browse to the desired input file(s),
whereas the R package searches through files in a specified directory
and selects data files based on the file name. Even if you are using the
Shiny app, consider using the file naming scheme below since you may
decide to use the R package at some point in the future. Another reason
to use the recommended file naming scheme is because it keeps files well
organized and sorts them in chronological order. This is particularly
helpful if you are using HOBO U20 water level loggers, as it makes
matching air and water sensor files easier during the processing step
and helps you identify gaps in the data.</p>
<p>If you are using the R package, there are four components to the file
name for single sensor deployments, which are separated by underscores
(“_”).</p>
<p><strong>SiteID_DataType_StartDate_EndDate</strong></p>
<p>Example: Hunting_Water_20130426_20130725</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Site ID (no spaces or underscores) = Hunting</p></li>
<li><p>Data Type options: Air, Water, AW (air and water sensor data are
combined into the same file), Gage, DO</p></li>
<li><p>Date, Start (YYYYMMDD) = 20130426</p></li>
<li><p>Date, End (YYYYMMDD) = 20130725</p></li>
</ul>
<p>For multi-sensor deployments (e.g., temperature sensors deployed at
multiple depths at a lake), add depth and units or some other
differentiating characteristic, such as sensor type, to the SiteID,
separated by double-dashes as shown below:</p>
<p>Example: RussWood–02M_Water_20130426_20130725</p>
<p>Depth can include decimals (for example, 0.1M is ok) and does not
need to include leading zeros (either 01M or 1M are acceptable). Units
can be upper or lower case (M or m), and abbreviated (M) or spelled out
(meters).</p>
<p>You can change the double-dash separator if desired by customizing
the <a href="Config_default.zip">configuration file</a> [ZIP] (for
example, you could change it to a tilde ~).</p>
<p>If you are using the Shiny app instead of R package, you are not
restricted to using the Data Types shown above (Air, Water, AW, etc.).
If you have more than one type of sensor deployed at the same depth
(e.g., both a DO and temperature sensor at 2M), consider using sensor
type in the second part of the file name (for example,
RussWood–02M_TEMP_20130426_20130725 or
RussWood–02M_DO_20130426_20130725).</p>
