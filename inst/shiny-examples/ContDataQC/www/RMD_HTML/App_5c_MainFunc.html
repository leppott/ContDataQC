<h1>QC Tips</h1>
<p>Below are instructional materials and links to resources we have
compiled as we continue to gain experience QCing continuous data. To
date, we have worked primarily with thermal and hydrologic data, and
more recently, dissolved oxygen data from lakes. The data are typically
downloaded 2-4 times a year. We have not worked with ‘real-time’
data.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feedback on ways to improve this process
or suggestions on additional materials that you feel would be helpful to
share, please contact Jen Stamp (<a href="mailto:Jen.Stamp@tetratech.com" class="email">Jen.Stamp@tetratech.com</a>).</p>
<div id="data-corrections" class="section level2">
<h2>Data corrections</h2>
<p>If you are processing data for the RMNs, we are currently
recommending the following approach</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are certain a data point is erroneous, delete the
measurement and flag as ‘F’. If you are not sure, flag the data as ‘S’
and do not delete. Let the people using the data decide whether to
remove questionable measurements from their analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Document that you checked each point flagged as ‘F’ and ‘S’ by
adding a data qualifier to the Comment column. Click <a href="DataQualifiers_20220210.xlsx">here</a> to download the list of
data qualifiers currently being used by RMN partners.</p></li>
<li><p>Leave missing data cells blank.</p></li>

<h2>Workflow</h2>
<p>Click <a href="Workflow_QC_report_20220824.pdf">here</a> for
recommendations on a workflow for reviewing the QC reports.</p>
<p>If you have a backlog of data files from multiple deployments and are
wondering how to most efficiently QC the files, <a href="Workflow_DataPileup_20220824.pdf">here</a> is a recommended
workflow.</p>
<p>Click <a href="SiteVisitChecklist.zip">here</a> for a site visit
checklist to help ensure that you do not forget to document information
that is important for the data QC process.</p>
</div>
<div id="sensor-configuration" class="section level2">
<h2>Sensor configuration</h2>
<p>Some people have had problems with air and water sensors being out of
sync ( e.g., one records at 11:00 and the other records at 11:07). If
you are deploying air and water sensors at a site, make sure they are
recording at the same time. This will make data processing faster and
easier. If you are using Onset HOBO sensors, click <a href="HOBO_ConfigLaunch_20170803.pdf">here</a> for tips on configuring
them in a way that ensures they will record at the same time.</p>
<p>Another issue that sometimes occurs is data overlap (where more than
one file has measurements covering part of the same time periods). If
you are using Onset HOBO sensors, click <a href="HOBO_DataDownload_20170823.pdf">here</a> for procedures to follow
during data download to clear sensor memory and avoid overlapping
data.</p>
</div>
<div id="accuracy-checks" class="section level2">
<h2>Accuracy checks</h2>
<p>Accuracy checks are comparisons of discrete or in situ measurements
taken in the lab and/or in the field with sensor measurements from the
closest date/time. The sensor measurement should be within the accuracy
quoted by the manufacturer ( e.g., ±0.2°C if you are using the Onset
HOBO proV2 sensor). Accuracy checks are used to validate your data, and
in some cases, correct for sensor drift. Click <a href="EXAMPLE_AccuracyCheckWkst.xlsx">here</a> to download an example of
an accuracy check worksheet being kept by an RMN partner.</p>
</div>
<div id="visual-checks-of-time-series-plots" class="section level2">
<h2>Visual checks of time series plots</h2>
<p>Visual checks of time series plots are an important part of the QC
process. Click <a href="PlotQC_WatchList_20220824.pdf">here</a> to see a
compilation of patterns to watch for when interpreting the plots. They
include ice cover, beaver activity, leaf packs, dewatering, and dead
batteries. We will continue to add slides to this as we receive
materials.</p>
</div>
<div id="checking-sensor-data-against-other-data-sources" class="section level2">
<h2>Checking sensor data against other data sources</h2>
<p>This is optional but encouraged if time permits. Click <a href="Daymet_Wx_Gage.zip">here</a> for instructional materials from
David Smith (Kentucky Division of Water) on how he has been downloading
data from nearby weather stations and USGS gages, as well as modeled air
temperature and precipitation data from Daymet (
<a href="https://daymet.ornl.gov/getdata" target="_blank">https://daymet.ornl.gov/getdata</a>
), and comparing those data to sensor measurements as part of his QC
process.</p>

<h2>Additional resources</h2>
<p><strong>Logger Processing App</strong></p>
<p>Developed by Tim Martin at the Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources for processing, organizing, and vetting continuous
environmental logger data. It has the same QC flag tests as ContDataQC
plus more, including an interactive plot that allows you to flag or
unflag data points.</p>

<p><strong>driftR, an R package that corrects drift in water quality
data</strong></p>
<p>It implements either one- or two-point variable data corrections
based on the number of standards used to calibrate the sensor of
interest, then linearly interpolates the correction over the period of
interest.</p>

<div id="wish-list-items" class="section level2">
<h2>Wish list items</h2>
<p>Items that we want to add in the future when resources permit</p>
<ul>
<li><p>‘Transition’ check</p></li>
<li><p>We’re finding most errors concentrated around the times when the
sensors are being taken out of position for data download. If you’re
only QCing individual files after each download, you’re not evaluating
the transition between data from the previous file and the new file.
This check would bring in data from 1-2 days prior to the start time of
the file being evaluated and alert users to data points that need to be
trimmed.</p></li>
<li><p>Automatic adjustments to gross limit QC test thresholds based on
season and depth</p></li>
<li><p>Right now the gross limit QC test is pretty limited because it
doesn’t capture seasonal differences without the user creating multiple
customized configuration files (and then the user would need to break up
the input files for each time period). We’d like to figure out a way to
have the R code automatically adjust the upper and lower gross limit
thresholds based on seasonal considerations, and for lakes, for it to
also make adjustments to gross limit thresholds based on depth.</p></li>
<li><p>Automated accuracy check</p></li>
<li><p>Users would upload in-situ files and the R code would
automatically match the in-situ measurements with the closest sensor
measurement, calculate the difference between the two measurements and
report whether the sensor is meeting accuracy specs.</p></li>
<li><p>Drift correction</p></li>
<li><p>We’d add a feature that automates drift corrections.</p></li>
<li><p>Weather station check</p></li>
<li><p>Users would upload weather station data and the R code would
match the measurements with the sensor data, generate time series plots
in which the measurements are overlaid on one another, and generate some
basic statistical measures to compare the two sets of data.</p></li>
<li><p>Daily range check (max-min)</p></li>
<li><p>This QC check is used by the USFS NorWeST temperature sensor
network. It would be added in as a new function.</p></li>
