<li><p>Click the ‘Browse’ button and select the desired input file from
the Data3_Aggregated folder. The status bar will tell you when the
upload is complete.</p></li>
<li><p>Select ‘Summary statistics’ from the ‘Choose Operation to
perform’ drop-down menu.</p></li>
<li><p>A ‘Run operation’ button will appear. Click this button. A status
bar will appear in the lower right corner.</p></li>
<li><p>After the function is done running, a ‘Download’ button will
appear. Click this button. You will be prompted to save a zipped file
named ‘SummaryStats.date_time.’ Save it in the Data4_Stats
folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Unzip/extract the file(s). After file is unzipped, a new folder
called ‘data’ will appear. If a ‘data’ folder already exists, outputs
will go into that folder. The summary stats reports have ‘STATS_’ as the
prefix in the file name. The original zipped file can be deleted if
desired.</p></li>
<li><p>Open and review the summary statistics reports. There should be
two sets of CSV files and a PDF with time series plots for each
parameter. One of the CSVs has daily means and the other has a wider
range of summary statistics (e.g., min, median, max, quartiles). Click
