<h1>Test Data</h1>
<p>Test data can be downloaded <a href="TestData_HOBOU20_20220822.zip">here</a>. The test data consist of
two comma-separated values (CSV) files that came from Onset U20 water
level loggers (non-vented pressure transducers) that were deployed in
the air and water. The files are from the same site but cover two
different time periods.</p>
<p>You’ll see two sets of folders:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Test</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The two files are in the Data0_Original folder and are ready to be
run through the HOBOware Reformat function. Next, run them through the
Main Functions to generate QC reports, aggregate the two QC’d CSV files
and summarize the data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Completed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This folder has the complete set of outputs for both files. .so that
you can see examples of the QC reports and other outputs without having
to run the test data through the R tool yourself. We are happy to add
more test data to this website. If you have example files that you would
like to contribute, please send them to Jen Stamp (<a href="mailto:Jen.Stamp@tetratech.com" class="email">Jen.Stamp@tetratech.com</a>).</li>
