<p>There are two sets of test files, one from Onset HOBO U20 water level
loggers (non-vented pressure transducers) and one from a miniDOT DO
sensor. We are happy to add more test data to this website. If you have
example files that you would like to contribute, please send them to Jen
Stamp (<a href="mailto:Jen.Stamp@tetratech.com" class="email">Jen.Stamp@tetratech.com</a>).</p>

<h1>Onset HOBO</h1>
<p>The Onset HOBO U20 files can be downloaded <a href="TestData_HOBOU20_20220822.zip">here</a> [ZIP]. The test data
consist of two comma-separated values (CSV) files. The files are from
the same site but cover two different time periods.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Test</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The two HOBO U20 test files are in the Data0_Original folder. Go to
the <strong>Automated Reformat – Onset HOBO</strong> tab and run both
files through the reformatting function. Multiple files can be run
through the function at the same time (in ‘batches’). The function
reformats the files so that they are ready to run through the QC report
function. Next, go to the <strong>Main Functions-Import Files</strong>
tab, import the reformatted files, run them through the ‘QC raw data’
function (multiple files can be run through the function at the same
time), check the flagged data (edit if needed), aggregate the two QC’d
CSV files with the ‘Aggregate QC’ed data’ function, and run the ‘Summary
Statistics’ function to summarize the data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Completed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This folder has the complete set of outputs for both files so that
you can see examples of the QC reports and other outputs without having
to run the test data through the R tool yourself.</li>
</ul></li>

<h1>miniDOT DO Sensors</h1>
<p>The miniDOT DO test files can be downloaded <a href="TestData_miniDOT.zip">here</a> [ZIP]. They are from one site and
one deployment period. You’ll see two sets of folders. Within each
folder are example input and output files.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>miniDOT_concatenate</strong> - When data are initially
downloaded from miniDOT sensors, there are separate .txt files for each
day (in this example, 325 individual files). Go to the <strong>Automated
Reformat – miniDOT</strong> tab and run the <strong>Concatenate</strong>
function to combine them all into one file.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>miniDOT_reformat</strong> – run the combined file through
the Reformat function. The function reformats the file so that it is
ready to run through the QC report function. Next, go to the Main
<strong>Functions-Import Files</strong>s tab, import the reformatted
file, run it through the ‘QC raw data’ function, and check the flagged
data (edit if needed).</p></li>
