<h2>Test files</h2>
<p>Below are test files that you can download and run through the Shiny
app. They are from Onset HOBO U20 water level loggers (non-vented
pressure transducers) and miniDOT DO sensors. Please contact us if you
have example files from other sensors that you would like us to add to
this website.</p>
<ul>

<h2>Onset HOBO</h2>
<p>The Onset HOBO U20 test data consist of two comma-separated values
(CSV) files. The files are from the same site but cover two different
time periods. You’ll see two folders:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Test</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The two HOBO U20 test files are in the Data0_Original folder. Go to
the <strong>Automated Reformat – Onset HOBO</strong> tab and run both
files through the reformatting function. Multiple files can be run
through the function at the same time (in ‘batches’). The function
reformats the files so that they are ready to run through the QC report
function. Next, go to the <strong>Main Functions-Import Files</strong>
tab, import the reformatted files, run them through the ‘QC raw data’
function (multiple files can be run through the function at the same
time), check the flagged data (edit if needed), aggregate the two QC’d
CSV files with the ‘Aggregate QC’ed data’ function, and run the ‘Summary
Statistics’ function to summarize the data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Completed</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>This folder has the complete set of outputs for both files so that
you can see examples of the QC reports and other outputs without having
to run the test data through the functions yourself.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<div id="minidot-do-sensors" class="section level2">
<h2>miniDOT DO Sensors</h2>
<p>The miniDOT DO test files are from one site and one deployment
period. You’ll see two sets of folders. Within each folder are example
input and output files.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>miniDOT_concatenate</strong> - When data are initially
downloaded from miniDOT sensors, there are separate .txt files for each
day (in this example, 325 individual files). Go to the <strong>Automated
Reformat – miniDOT</strong> tab and run the <strong>Concatenate</strong>
function to combine them all into one file.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>miniDOT_reformat</strong> – run the combined file through
the Reformat function. The function reformats the file so that it is
ready to run through the QC report function. Next, go to the Main
<strong>Functions-Import Files</strong> tab, import the reformatted
file, run it through the ‘QC raw data’ function, and check the flagged
data (edit if needed).</p></li>
</ul>
