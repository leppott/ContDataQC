<h3>Who to contact if you have problems or comments</h3>
This is an open-source, collaborative effort and we welcome your
feedback. If you encounter problems with the Shiny app and/or have
suggestions on ways to further improve it, please contact Erik W. Leppo
from Tetra Tech via email (<a href="mailto:Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com" class="email">Erik.Leppo@tetratech.com</a>) or via a post on the
ContDataQC GitHub page

<h3>Experience to date</h3>
<p>We have been working on and off on the ContDataQC R package and Shiny
app since 2017. Development of the ContDataQC R tools has been funded
primarily by the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)
Office of Research and Development (ORD) as part of a larger project to
establish Regional Monitoring Networks (RMNs) for freshwater streams and
inland lakes. The lead EPA scientist on the RMN work is Britta Bierwagen
(<a href="mailto:bierwagen.britta@epa.gov" class="email">bierwagen.britta@epa.gov</a>). Shane Bowe from the Red
Lake Band of Chippewa Indians has also funded parts of its
development.</p>
<p>So far ContDataQC has only been used on continuous data that is being
manually downloaded periodically (generally one to three times a year).
It has not been used on ‘real-time’ continuous data. It was originally
developed for sensors deployed in streams at single depths but is now
being used on lake sensor array data as well, where sensors are being
deployed at multiple, fixed depths at the same site. To date, we have
worked primarily with thermal and hydrologic data (the primary variables
being collected at RMN sites), but users have expressed interest in
using it on other parameters as well. The Shiny app is currently set up
to run dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH, turbidity and chlorophyll-a
data but the default QC test thresholds for those parameters will need
to be carefully checked and refined.</p>

<h3>Plans for 2021-2022</h3>
<p>In fall of 2020, a major advancement occurred when we moved the Shiny
app to the Tetra Tech Shiny server. This made the app much more
accessible to RMN partners and to other outside users as well. EPA is
planning to host the ContDataQC Shiny app on an EPA Shiny server as
well. We expect this to happen over the coming year.</p>
<p>We aren’t planning to make any major changes to the main functions in
ContDataQC but will continue to work on the items below as resources
permit. We’ll also be shifting our focus more to data summary and
visualization, for which we are developing separate R packages and Shiny
apps (for more information, see bottom of page).</p>
<p><strong>Here are the ContDataQC items we’re currently working on
-</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Improving the instructional materials</p></li>
<li><p>Refining the QC test thresholds, not just for temperature and
hydrology (the primary variables being collected at RMN sites), but also
for dissolved oxygen, conductivity, pH and turbidity.</p></li>
<li><p>Gaining a better understanding of the most common QC issues being
encountered and how to best detect and address (or potentially prevent)
those issues.</p></li>
<li><p>Improving guidance on addressing errors and flagged data points
and documenting corrections and metadata.</p></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>ContDataQC ‘wish list’ items (that we lack funding to address
but will tackle if resources permit) -</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Automated accuracy check</p>
<ul>
<li>Users would upload in-situ files and the R code would automatically
match the in-situ measurements with the closest sensor measurement,
calculate the difference between the two measurements and report whether
the sensor is meeting accuracy specs.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Weather station check</p>
<ul>
<li>Users would upload weather station data and the R code would match
the measurements with the sensor data, generate time series plots in
which the measurements are overlaid on one another, and generate some
basic statistical measures to compare the two sets of data.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Daily range check (max-min)</p>
<ul>
<li>This QC check is used by the USFS NorWeST temperature sensor
network. It would be added in as a new function.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>‘Transition’ check</p>
<ul>
<li>We’re finding most errors concentrated around the times when the
sensors are being taken out of position for data download. If you’re
only QCing individual files after each download, you’re not evaluating
the transition between data from the previous file and the new file.
This check would bring in data from 1-2 days prior to the start time of
the file being evaluated and alert users to data points that need to be
trimmed.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Automatic adjustments to gross limit QC test thresholds based on
season and depth</p>
<ul>
<li>Right now the gross limit QC test is pretty limited because it
doesn’t capture seasonal differences without the user creating multiple
customized configuration files (and then the user would need to break up
the input files for each time period). We’d like to figure out a way to
have the R code automatically adjust the upper and lower gross limit
thresholds based on seasonal considerations, and for lakes, for it to
also make adjustments to gross limit thresholds based on depth.</li>
</ul></li>
<li><p>Drift correction</p>
<ul>
<li>We’d add a feature that automates drift corrections.</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Other R packages and Shiny apps that may be of
interest</strong></p>
Tim Martin from Minnesota DNR (<a href="mailto:tim.martin@state.mn.us" class="email">tim.martin@state.mn.us</a>) has been a great collaborator
and has developed a QC app that includes the ContData QC flag tests as
well as some other features (including an interactive plot in which data
points are color-coded based on flags and the user can add or remove
flags). The app is currently being hosted on the Tetra Tech Shiny server

This work is being funded by Shane Bowe from the Red Lake Band of
Chippewa Indians (via a BIA grant) and EPA ORD.</p>
<p>Over the coming year, we’ll also be working on new tools for
summarizing and visualizing the stream RMN data (thermal, hydrologic and
biological data).</p>
There are other existing software programs for working with continuous
data. One example is the open source Python-based tool by Horsburgh et
al. (2015), which provides a data quality control work flow, allows for
flagging of data based on visual inspection, can apply drift corrections
and interpolate missing values (if desired) and saves both original and
edited data for documentation. Other existing software options include a
sensorQC R package by USGS
