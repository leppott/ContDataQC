<h1>Check input file before running the QC function</h1>
<p>After uploading the input file(s), check the summary table to see
what parameters are in the uploaded files. Ensure that all the desired
parameters are present before running the QC function.</p>
<p>Note: sometimes people have a mix of correct and incorrect column
headings in the input file. When this happens, R does not give you an
error message. It only carries forward the parameters that have the
correct column headings and leaves the others blank. That is why
checking this summary table is important.</p>
