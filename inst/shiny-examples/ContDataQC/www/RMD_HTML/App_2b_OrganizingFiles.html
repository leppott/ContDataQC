<h1>Organizing Files</h1>
<p>If you do not already have a good system for organizing continuous
data files, we recommend that you set up a folder for each site, and
within each site folder, set up subfolders as shown in the table below.
You can download a ready-made set of (empty) folders by clicking <a href="SiteX_20230828.zip">here</a> [ZIP]. Put the file in the desired
location, unzip it and then replace ‘SiteX’ with the appropriate site
name.</p>
<p>You have more flexibility with file organization when using the Shiny
app vs R package. With the Shiny app, it is not necessary to name the
folders exactly as shown below because you can browse to the desired
input files and browse to save the output files to the desired location.
However, if you decide to use the R package at some point, keeping the
four ‘Data’ folders (Data0_Original, Data1_RAW, Data2_QC,
Data3_Aggregated and Data4_Stats) will be important since the R code
searches in specific folders for input files and outputs files to
specific directories. Advanced users can modify the default directories
by editing the configuration file.</p>

HOBOWare) that need to be reformatted before they can be run through the
QC function.

<td style="text-align:left;">
After you run the QC function, put the QC reports into this folder. Make
corrections to the .csv QC files as needed. When you run the Aggregate
function, you will use the QC’d data files from this folder.

<td style="text-align:left;">
After you run the Aggregate function to combine the QC’d data files, put
the output files into this folder. When you run the SummaryStats
function, you will use the aggregated data files from this folder.

After you run the SummaryStats function, put the output files into this

FieldForms
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Observations from site visits are very important for the QC process as
they can provide clues as to why erroneous measurements or changes may
have occurred (e.g., sensor movement, sensor out of water, sensor buried
in sediment, vandalism).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
in_situ
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
An important QC check (which we call an ‘accuracy check’) involves
comparing in situ measurements taken during site visits to the closest
sensor measurement(s). We recommend keeping an accuracy check worksheet
in this folder (click link at bottom to download an example worksheet).

orig
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
If you are overrun with raw files that are not named consistently and
are poorly organized (for example, sometimes files are saved multiple
times with different names and in different folders), it may be helpful
to put all the raw files for a site into one folder, inventory them, and
then sort them into the appropriate folders.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Photos
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
We recommend taking photos from the same locations during each site
visit. Photographs are important for relocating the sensors and
documenting changes to the monitoring location.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
R_ConfigurationFiles
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
Creating a customized configuration file (or files) for a site allows
users to adjust QC test thresholds, make changes to units and more. The
customized file needs to be uploaded before running the QC function,
otherwise the default settings will be used.
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">
SensorFile
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
We recommend retaining original sensor files in case you need to go back
and regenerate certain data. In some situations, it may be helpful to
add subfolders for each sensor type (for example, with lakes, there may
be many temperature files mixed in with DO and water level files; in
these cases, it may be easier to find files if you create subfolders for
temperature, DO and water level).
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:left;">

<td style="text-align:left;">
If there is a nearby, representative USGS gage, we recommend comparing
sensor hydrologic data to the USGS gage data as an additional QC check.
</td>
</tr>

<td style="text-align:left;">
WxStation
</td>
<td style="text-align:left;">
If there is a nearby, representative weather station, we recommend
comparing your sensor data to the weather station data as an additional
QC check. Modeled daily air temperature and precipitation data are also
available from Daymet (<a href="https://daymet.ornl.gov/" class="uri">https://daymet.ornl.gov/</a>) and PRISM (<a href="https://prism.oregonstate.edu/" class="uri">https://prism.oregonstate.edu/</a>).
