<h3>Aggregate</h3>
<p>Shiny app instructions</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Click the ‘Browse’ button and select the QC’d input files that
you’d like to combine. The input files need to be from the same site and
share common parameters. The status bar will tell you when the upload is
complete.</p></li>
<li><p>Select ‘Aggregate QC’d data’ from the ‘Choose Operation to
perform’ drop-down menu.</p></li>
<li><p>A ‘Run operation’ button will appear. Click this button. A status
bar will appear in the lower right corner.</p></li>
<li><p>After the function is done running, a ‘Download’ button will
appear. Click this button. You will be prompted to save a zipped file
named ‘Aggregate.date_time.’ Save it in the Data3_Aggregated
folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Unzip/extract the file(s). After file is unzipped, a new folder
called ‘data’ will appear. If a ‘data’ folder already exists, outputs
will go into that folder. The aggregate reports have ‘DATA_’ as the
prefix in the file name. The original zipped file can be deleted if
desired.</p></li>
<li><p>Open and review the aggregated reports. As with the QC output,
there are two types of outputs: a Word document Data Quality Control
Report and a comma-delimited (.csv) spreadsheet. Click <a href="Example_Aggregate.zip">here</a> to download an example of an
Aggregate output. If users prefer a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)
report instead of Word, they can change the format in the configuration
file (this requires some familiarity with R code).</p></li>
