<h1>Tips</h1>
<p>Below are tips and links to resources from the Regional Monitoring
Network (RMN) project. To date, RMN partners have worked primarily with
thermal and hydrologic data, and more recently, with dissolved oxygen
data from lakes. The data are typically downloaded 2-4 times a year (not
‘real-time’ data).</p>
<div id="site-visits" class="section level2">
<h2>Site visits</h2>
<p>It helps speed up the Quality Control (QC) process if you follow a
checklist during site visits and document anything that might affect the
quality of the data (e.g., sensor out of water or buried in sediment,
beaver activity, low battery). * <strong>Resource:</strong> <a href="SiteVisitChecklist.zip">Site visit checklist</a> [ZIP]</p>

<div id="sensor-configuration" class="section level2">
<h2>Sensor configuration</h2>
<p>Some people have had problems with air and water sensors being out of
sync ( e.g., one records at 11:00 and the other records at 11:07). If
you are deploying air and water sensors at a site, make sure you
configure them so that they are recording at the same time. This will
make data processing faster and easier. * <strong>Resource:</strong> <a href="HOBO_ConfigLaunch_20170803.pdf">Onset HOBO configuration tips</a>
[PDF]</p>
<p>Another issue that sometimes occurs is data overlap (where more than
one file has measurements covering part of the same time periods). Make
sure you clear the sensor’s memory when you download data and relaunch
sensors to avoid overlapping data. * <strong>Resource:</strong> <a href="HOBO_DataDownload_20170823.pdf">Onset HOBO download and relaunch
tips</a> [PDF]</p>

<div id="qc-workflow" class="section level2">
<h2>QC workflow</h2>
<p>There are generally two scenarios: 1) users QC their data after each
download and work with one file per site at a time; or 2) users have a
backlog of data that cover multiple deployment periods that they
aggregate into one file before performing QC. *
<strong>Resources:</strong> Suggested workflows for each scenario: + <a href="Workflow_QC_report_20220824.pdf">Single file</a> [PDF] + <a href="Workflow_DataPileup_20220824.pdf">Multiple files</a> [PDF]</p>

<div id="data-edits" class="section level2">
<h2>Data edits</h2>
<p>When reviewing the QC reports, it is important to be consistent in
how you handle flagged data. Here is an example of an approach -</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are certain a data point is erroneous, delete the
measurement and flag as ‘F’. If you are not sure, flag the data as ‘S’
and do not delete. Let the people using the data decide whether to
remove questionable measurements from their analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Document that you checked each point flagged as ‘F’ and ‘S’ by
adding a note or data qualifier to the Comment column.</p></li>

<li><p>Leave missing data cells as is (vs. deleting)</p></li>
</ul>

<div id="accuracy-checks" class="section level2">
<h2>Accuracy checks</h2>
<p>Accuracy checks are comparisons of discrete or in situ measurements
taken in the lab and/or in the field with sensor measurements from the
closest date/time. The difference between the sensor and discrete
measurements should be within the accuracy quoted by the manufacturer
(e.g., ±0.2°C if you are using the Onset HOBO proV2 sensor). *

<div id="visual-checks-of-time-series-plots" class="section level2">
<h2>Visual checks of time series plots</h2>
<p>Visual checks of time series plots are an important part of the QC
process. Some issues, such as dewatering, sediment burial, ice cover and
beaver activity, show fairly common patterns, and we’ve been compiling
examples of these patterns to help people recognize potential QC issues
with their data. * <strong>Resource:</strong> <a href="PlotQC_WatchList_20220824.pdf">Visual checks</a> [PDF]</p>

<div id="checking-sensor-data-against-other-data-sources" class="section level2">
<h2>Checking sensor data against other data sources</h2>
<p>Some partners have been downloading data from nearby weather stations
and USGS gages, as well as modeled air temperature and precipitation
data from sources such as Daymet
(<a class="menu__link" href="https://daymet.ornl.gov/getdata" target="_blank"><a href="https://daymet.ornl.gov/getdata" class="uri">https://daymet.ornl.gov/getdata</a><span class="usa-tag external-link__tag" title="Exit EPA Website"> <span aria-hidden="true">Exit</span> <span class="u-visually-hidden"> Exit EPA

measurements as part of their QC process. * <strong>Resource:</strong>
