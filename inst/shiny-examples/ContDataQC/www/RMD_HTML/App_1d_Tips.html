<h1>QC Tips</h1>
<p>Below are instructional materials and links to resources we have
compiled as we continue to gain experience QCing continuous data. To
date, we have worked primarily with thermal and hydrologic data, and
more recently, dissolved oxygen data from lakes. The data are typically
downloaded 2-4 times a year. We have not worked with ‘real-time’
data.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, feedback on ways to improve this process
or suggestions on additional materials that you feel would be helpful to
share, please contact Jen Stamp (<a href="mailto:Jen.Stamp@tetratech.com" class="email">Jen.Stamp@tetratech.com</a>).</p>
<div id="data-corrections" class="section level2">
<h2>Data corrections</h2>
<p>If you are processing data for the RMNs, we are currently
recommending the following approach</p>
<ul>
<li><p>If you are certain a data point is erroneous, delete the
measurement and flag as ‘F’. If you are not sure, flag the data as ‘S’
and do not delete. Let the people using the data decide whether to
remove questionable measurements from their analysis.</p></li>
<li><p>Document that you checked each point flagged as ‘F’ and ‘S’ by
adding a data qualifier to the Comment column. Click <a href="DataQualifiers_20220210.xlsx">here</a> [XLSX] to download the list
of data qualifiers currently being used by RMN partners.</p></li>
<li><p>Leave missing data cells blank.</p></li>

<h2>Workflow</h2>
<p>Click <a href="Workflow_QC_report_20220824.pdf">here</a> [PDF] for
recommendations on a workflow for reviewing the QC reports.</p>
<p>If you have a backlog of data files from multiple deployments and are
wondering how to most efficiently QC the files, <a href="Workflow_DataPileup_20220824.pdf">here</a> [PDF] is a recommended
workflow.</p>

information that is important for the data QC process.</p>

<div id="sensor-configuration" class="section level2">
<h2>Sensor configuration</h2>
<p>Some people have had problems with air and water sensors being out of
sync ( e.g., one records at 11:00 and the other records at 11:07). If
you are deploying air and water sensors at a site, make sure they are
recording at the same time. This will make data processing faster and
easier. If you are using Onset HOBO sensors, click <a href="HOBO_ConfigLaunch_20170803.pdf">here</a> [PDF] for tips on
configuring them in a way that ensures they will record at the same
time.</p>
<p>Another issue that sometimes occurs is data overlap (where more than
one file has measurements covering part of the same time periods). If
you are using Onset HOBO sensors, click <a href="HOBO_DataDownload_20170823.pdf">here</a> [PDF] for procedures to
follow during data download to clear sensor memory and avoid overlapping
data.</p>

<div id="accuracy-checks" class="section level2">
<h2>Accuracy checks</h2>
<p>Accuracy checks are comparisons of discrete or in situ measurements
taken in the lab and/or in the field with sensor measurements from the
closest date/time. The sensor measurement should be within the accuracy
quoted by the manufacturer ( e.g., ±0.2°C if you are using the Onset
HOBO proV2 sensor). Accuracy checks are used to validate your data, and
in some cases, correct for sensor drift. Click <a href="EXAMPLE_AccuracyCheckWkst.xlsx">here</a> [XLSX] to download an
example of an accuracy check worksheet being kept by an RMN partner.</p>

<div id="visual-checks-of-time-series-plots" class="section level2">
<h2>Visual checks of time series plots</h2>
<p>Visual checks of time series plots are an important part of the QC
process. Click <a href="PlotQC_WatchList_20220824.pdf">here</a> [PDF] to
see a compilation of patterns to watch for when interpreting the plots.
They include ice cover, beaver activity, leaf packs, dewatering, and
dead batteries. We will continue to add slides to this as we receive
materials.</p>

<h2>Checking sensor data against other data sources</h2>
This is optional but encouraged if time permits. Click <a href="Daymet_Wx_Gage.zip">here</a> [ZIP] for instructional materials
from David Smith (Kentucky Division of Water) on how he has been
downloading data from nearby weather stations and USGS gages, as well as
modeled air temperature and precipitation data from Daymet (
