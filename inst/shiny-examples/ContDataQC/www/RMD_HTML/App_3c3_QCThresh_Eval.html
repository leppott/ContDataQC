<h2>Evaluate Thresholds</h2>
<p>If you have one or more years of continuous data for a site, we
encourage you to evaluate the performance of the QC test thresholds for
each parameter at that site and customize the configuration file if
needed. Make sure you consider what units you are using, since units
have a large effect on thresholds.</p>
<p><strong>Resources for evaluating thresholds:</strong> * <a href="EvaluateThresholds.zip">Pivot tables and charts</a> [ZIP] for
evaluating the Unrealistic values (‘Gross range’) and Spike tests in
Excel. * <a href="TimMartin_R_ThresholdEval.zip">R code statistics</a>
[ZIP] that can help inform thresholds for all four QC tests. * <a href="ThresholdsCheckWorksheet_20220826.xlsx">Threshold evaluation
worksheet</a> [XLSX] that lists the default thresholds for each
parameter and has columns where you enter customized thresholds for one
or multiple sites.</p>
