<h3>QC reports</h3>
<p><strong>Example</strong> <a href="Example_QCreports.zip">QC
reports</a> [ZIP]</p>
<p>Instructions for generating QC reports using the ContDataQC Shiny
app:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Click the ‘Browse’ button and select the input file(s) from the
Data1_RAW folder. You can run multiple files at once. The status bar
will tell you when the upload is complete.</p></li>
<li><p>Select ‘QC raw data’ from the ‘Choose operation to perform’
drop-down menu</p></li>
<li><p>Click the ‘Run operation’ button will appears. A status bar will
appear in the lower right corner.</p></li>
<li><p>After the function is done running, click the ‘Download’ button
that appears. Click this button.</p></li>
<li><p>You will be prompted to save a zipped file named
‘QCRaw.date_time.’ Save it in the Data2_QC folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Unzip/extract the file(s). After file is unzipped, a new folder
called ‘data’ will appear, which contains QC reports that have ‘QC_’ as
the prefix in the file name. The original zipped file can be deleted if
desired.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the QC reports. There are two types of outputs: a Word
document Data Quality Control Report and a comma-delimited (.csv)
spreadsheet. If users prefer a Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) report
instead of Word, they can change the format in the configuration file
(this requires some familiarity with R code). The reports include
results from the ‘flag’ tests (gross, spike, rate of change and flat
line), missing data checks, and time series plots.</p></li>
<li><p>Review each set of files, check flagged data points, do visual
checks on the time series plots, and decide if and how to make
corrections. For tips on the QC process, see the <strong>About &gt;&gt;
Tips</strong> subtab.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Data Quality Control Report is organized into four main sections
(starting with an overall summary followed by summaries for each
parameter):</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Data file information (siteID, date range, parameters, recording
interval, QC test thresholds reference table).</p></li>
<li><p>‘Count’ tables (# measurements/day) so that you can find
inconsistencies (too few measurements, indicating missing data, or too
many measurements) for each parameter.</p></li>
<li><p>Results from the four ‘flag’ tests (gross, spike, rate of change
and flat line), which show the # of entries for each parameter marked as
pass (P), suspect (S), fail (F), missing data (X) or not available
(NA).</p></li>
<li><p>Time series plots for each individual parameter and two sets of
combined parameters (water and air temperature; water temperature and
water level). If the input file includes discrete/in situ values that
were taken during site visits for accuracy checks, the discrete values
are plotted with the sensor data.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The CSV file contains the time series data from the sensor plus
additional data columns with flags for each test and parameter (e.g.,
Flag.Spike.Water.Temp.C, Flag.Flat.Water.Temp.C), comment fields for
each parameter (e.g., Comment.MOD.Water.Temp.C) so that the user can
document rationale for any changes, and a duplicate set of the original
‘raw’ data values (e.g., RAW.Water.Temp.C). The ‘raw’ values are
included so that the user can maintain documentation of changes that are
made and if needed go back to change how they handled a correction.</p>
<p>Currently there are no automated corrections programmed into the QC
function. The user must make the changes manually. For tips on the QC
process, see the ‘About - Tips’ subtab.</p>
