<h3>QC reports</h3>
<p>Shiny app instructions</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Click the ‘Browse’ button and select the input file(s) from the
Data1_RAW folder. You can run multiple files at once. The status bar
will tell you when the upload is complete.</p></li>
<li><p>Select ‘QC Raw Data’ from the ‘Choose Operation to perform’
drop-down menu</p></li>
<li><p>A ‘Run operation’ button will appear. Click this button. A status
bar will appear in the lower right corner.</p></li>
<li><p>After the function is done running, a ‘Download’ button will
appear. Click this button.</p></li>
<li><p>You will be prompted to save a zipped file named
‘QCRaw.date_time.’ Save it in the Data2_QC folder.</p></li>
<li><p>Unzip/extract the file(s). After file is unzipped, a new folder
called ‘data’ will appear, which contains QC reports that have ‘QC_’ as
the prefix in the file name. The original zipped file can be deleted if
desired.</p></li>
<li><p>Open the QC reports. There are two types of outputs: a Word
document Data Quality Control Report and a comma-delimited (.csv)
spreadsheet. The reports include results from the ‘flag’ tests (gross,
spike, rate of change and flat line), missing data checks and time
series plots. Click <a href="Example_QCreports.zip">here</a> to download
an example of a QC output. If users prefer a Hypertext Markup Language
(HTML) report instead of Word, they can change the format in the
configuration file (this requires some familiarity with R
code).</p></li>
<li><p>Review each set of files, check flagged data points, do visual
checks on the time series plots, and decide if and how to make
corrections. For tips on the QC process, see the ‘About - QC tips’
subtab.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The Data Quality Control Report is organized into four main sections,
starting with an overall summary followed by summaries for each
parameter:</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Data file information (siteID, date range, parameters, recording
interval, QC test thresholds reference table)</p></li>
<li><p>‘Count’ tables (# measurements/day) so that you can find
inconsistencies (too few measurements (=missing data) or too many
measurements)</p></li>
<li><p>Results from the four ‘flag’ tests (gross, spike, rate of change
and flat line) - # of entries marked as pass (P), suspect (S), fail (F),
missing data (X) or not available (NA)</p></li>
<li><p>Time series plots for each individual parameter and two sets of
combined parameters (water and air temperature; water temperature and
water level). If the input file includes discrete/in situ values , which
are taken during site visits for accuracy checks, the discrete values
are plotted with the sensor data.</p></li>
</ol>
<p>The CSV file contains the time series data from the sensor plus
additional data columns with flags for each test and parameter (e.g.,
Flag.Spike.Water.Temp.C, Flag.Flat.Water.Temp.C), comment fields for
each parameter (e.g., Comment.MOD.Water.Temp.C) so that the user can
document rationale for any changes and a duplicate set of the original
‘raw’ data values (e.g., RAW.Water.Temp.C). The ‘raw’ values are
included so that the user can maintain documentation of changes that are
made and go back at a later time if desired to change how they handled a
correction.</p>
<p>Currently there are no automated corrections programmed into the QC
function. The user must make the changes manually. For tips on the QC
process, see the ‘About - QC tips’ subtab.</p>
