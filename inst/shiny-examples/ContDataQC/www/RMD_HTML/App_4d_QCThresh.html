<h2>Upload Custom Thresholds</h2>
<p>Click the ‘Browse’ button (to the left) and select the desired
customized configuration file. The status bar will tell you when the
file has been uploaded. A new button will appear that gives you the
option of returning to the default configuration file. Do not click this
unless you change your mind and n o longer want to use the customized
file.</p>
<p>Go to the ‘Main Functions’ tab; select the desired input file(s); run
them through the QC function. Save the output to the desired location.
Open the Word or html QC report and scroll to the ‘Thresholds, Quick
Reference’ table (in the middle section of the report). Verify that the
correct thresholds were used.</p>
<p>Be aware that each time you close and reopen the Shiny app, it will
automatically revert back to the default configuration file. Also –
remember the sequencing! If you forget to upload the customized
configuration file prior to running the QC function, it will use the
default thresholds.</p>
